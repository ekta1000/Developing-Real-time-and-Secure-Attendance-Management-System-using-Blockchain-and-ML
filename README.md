# Developing-Real-time-and-Secure-Attendance-Management-System-using-Blockchain-and-ML

The project utilizes blockchain technology to ensure secure and
transparent recording of attendance data, while OpenCV (Open Source
Computer Vision) is employed for efficient and accurate face recognition
to verify the presence of individuals. The dashboard to monitor the
attendance is built using Flask.
